TODO (Sam)
=======================

Definitions library included in test environment
=> object reference by id and username not longer needed.
TODO: 
	Avoid accessing repositories in method extention classes.
	Change method parameters from id and name to object references.
	Search repositories in controller class.

Avoid using Delete and Add methods to update. Use Update method instead.
Remember to use the appropriate return types for every extention method. 
This makes it possible to update database entities.

Code runs server sided. Cannot access data from client.


??? When assigning a ticket to a responsible member, is the member referenced by username, id or object ???

Use private field mappers in persistence controller instead of local mappers.


Don't use casting when converting status id to status enum.
=> This can lead to future errors when database status and defenitions status do not match.
TODO:
	Use a switch when assigning status in the mappers.

There must be a better way to update ticket and device in method AcceptAanvraag.
TODO: Find something to replace tuple.

Add GetApparaten method to user methods and controller.
